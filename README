To keep up with the latest version, please set TEMPLATE_DIR in "bin/symlink.py"
of your *OWN* paper repository to the correct path of your local paper-template
directory, then run the following command to create symbolic links in your
*OWN* paper repository based on this template.

    $ ./bin/symlink.py

After that, you can add your *OWN* paper files to a new repository and invite
others to work on it.

Please refer to https://github.com/tsgates/die/blob/master/README for build
